<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
<p class="html-context">HyperText Markup Language, or HTML for short, is a common and widely-used computer language used by Webpage Designers. With HTML, you can design your very own Webpage as well. <strong>Just like I did!</strong></p>
<p class="html-context">Webpage Designers MUST learn this type of language, including CSS.</p>
<h3>HTML + CSS = <span class="span-html">Endless Designs + Efficiency</span></h3>
<p class="html-context">With Cascading StyleSheets (CSS), styling HTML webpages became a lot more easier, as it doesn't require you to specify properties to EVERY single element on the webpage INTERNALLY.</p>
<p class="html-context">With a simple &lt;link&gt; tag, the HTML webpage that the tag is applied to will follow the specifications on the linked CSS file.</p>
<p class="html-context">All of these stuff mentioned above might sound like a bunch of nonsense to you if you're a beginner. But don't worry! I'll guide you through all of this!</p>
